A Vim plugin for looking up meaning of words inside Vim and Bash using StarDict Command-Line Version (SDCV) dictionary program.

In addition to opening a Vim split and populating it with the output of StarDict Command-Line Version (SDCV), vim-stardict takes advantage of Vim syntax highlighting and some basic regexes to present the words' definitions to the users in an organized and user-friendly way.

The plugin was inspired and originally a fork of chusiang/vim-sdcv: https://github.com/chusiang/vim-sdcv
